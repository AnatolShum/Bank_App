# Online hackathon Bank_App
Task
Create a prototype of a banking application that has four functions:

displaying the balance on a bank deposit,
withdrawing cash from a bank deposit,
replenishing a bank deposit with cash,
replenishing the phone balance from the deposit.
You can use Realm as a database when developing.

The application should first display expenses and then deposits.

*You can also apply the MVC approach in the implementation of data handling methods (this task is not mandatory, but is desirable to perform).
